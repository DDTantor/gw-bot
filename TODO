TODO:

The first bot beta is completed. I tested only some basic stuff so it probably will be buggy but I'm releasing it early so you
break it and find as many bugs as possible for me to fix
COMMANDS
$log
$dur
$dps

$log "log1 log2 log3..." - enter log into the bot, need to be seperated by whitespaces, takes about 2-5s per log. If its a new
entry of some stuff (such as boss, phase, class etc) then its closer to 5s

$dur "skor, start, Phase 3" p - gives you time it took to reach skorvald Phase 3. Instead of start you can do end or full
end gives you when does the phase end and dur gives you the duration of the phase. Parameter p is for power, if you write
c he will only look at condi logs. If you leave it out it will look through both

$dps "skor, full, Phase 1, delay/wea" p - gives you delay dps in p1 of skorvald when he played weaver while we were power.
Parameters similar to the dur function except now the last thing in "" you write is player/class. If you want only player
just write "player" and if you want only class write "/class" THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

Break it, play with it. I don't have a function which deletes the log because for now I don't know how to do it properly
because 1 log inserts like 40 entries.
